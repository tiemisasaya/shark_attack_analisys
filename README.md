Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kPTYsT-Wx4bM0BwjDGeYdZd_LhtJ8kJwgeYXlhc8olo/edit#slide=id.g6c52a2e8d8_0_177 

### Objective:
Determine if the climatic fenomenon "El ni単o" has influence in occurence of shark attacks in coasts of affected countries.

### Process:
El ni単o, among other things, affetcs the temperature of the ocean in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. It is known that sharks can be atracted
to warmer water when looking for food. It is an irregular fenomenon, can last from 2 to 7 years.

I examined the number of attacks that happened during the last El ni単o classified as "strong" (1997 to 1998) and compared to a controle group, the next two year (1999 to 2000).

### Conclusion: 
Yes, it does :p 

### Challenges faced: 
The ideal country to analize is Peru, since is one of the most affected and ir only has coast territory on the Pacific Ocean, but there are no record of attacks in this location on the database analised.

Since the database is incomplete the conclusion can only be confirmed after more analisys, comparing more periods affected and non-affected.

### Next steps:
Analize the number of attacks only in countries affected by El ni単o and by coast.
